## Features:

- Buying and mortgaging of properties
- Chance and Community cards 
- Jail
- Dice
- Display for players information
- Seperate window for the information of a given property and the players list of properties

## I learned how to:
- Collaborate on a coding project (this was my first coding group project)
- Override and paint onto the JFrame directly
- Parse and organize the data from text files 
- Store data for the information related to the properties
- Display images onto the main window and sub-windows
- Implement Java lambda expression
- Use recursion to allow the next player who isn't out to play
